00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,919
So I don't think most people realize this, but the US government is now an investor in the stock market.

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,839
They're calling it the new economic strategy. So here's what happened.

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:19,320
In the last few months, the US government took ownership in some of the most strategically important corporations in America.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,839
Now, it owns about 10% of Intel, the company that makes our microchips, 15% of a company called MP Materials,

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:33,000
which is the only rare earth mining company in the country, about 10% of Lithium Americas,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,600
which controls one of the biggest Lithium deposits in North America.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:47,920
And it also has what President Trump calls a Golden Share in US Steel, which gives the US veto power over decisions made by a private company.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,679
So all of these companies, which were once privately owned, are now part owned and in some cases controlled by the US government.
