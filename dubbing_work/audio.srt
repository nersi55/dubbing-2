When people are lying to somebody else, I mean, knowingly lying, the body language that matters the most is not eye contact.

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,800
That's what people focus that they think eye contact is the most important signal.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not because people learn very different things in different households and cultures, personality differences that change how people choose to make eye contact in different situations.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What matters is the asyncranny between the emotions conveyed with the words and the emotions conveyed with the body language.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So if you're telling a happy story but you do not look happy, your body language doesn't look happy, you don't come across as authentic.
