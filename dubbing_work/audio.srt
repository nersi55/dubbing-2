1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
We lost $4 billion.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
$4 billion.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,280
Yeah, and things just get getting worse.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,640
We were also sued.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
When you lose a lot of money, we didn't get sued by our investors,

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,040
but we got sued by a shareholder because when the stock price goes down,

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,679
shareholder's sued.

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,679
We'd done nothing wrong rather than make a big mistake.

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,719
But, you know, so you have litigation.

10
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,920
Your investors are taking their money out.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,760
I'm in the middle of the divorce.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,560
The divorce starts to proceed.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,600
My ex-wife's lawyers' expectations of what my net worth was,

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,439
about three times what it actually was, and it was going lower in the middle of this.

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,079
I learned this method for dealing with these kind of moments,

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,520
which is you just make a little progress every day.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,560
So today, I'm going to wake up.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm going to make progress.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
You know, make progress in the litigation.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,120
Make progress in the portfolio.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,439
I'll make progress with my life.

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,079
And progress compounds.

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,719
Bit like money compounds.

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,200
You don't see a lot of progress in the first few weeks,

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,680
but like 30 days in, like, oh, OK.

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,359
You can't look up the mountaintop, or you used to be.

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
Because then you'll give up.

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,079
But you're just OK.

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,079
Just make step by step by step.

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,079
And then 90 days in, you're like, OK, I was way down there.

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,079
OK.

32
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,560
I'm OK.

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,159
I don't look up.

34
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,960
Just keep making progress, progress, progress.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,439
And progress really does compound.

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,200
And one day you wake up, I'm like, wow.

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,879
It's amazing how far I've come.
