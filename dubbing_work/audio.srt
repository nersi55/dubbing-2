1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
When people are lying to somebody else,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,299
I mean, knowingly lying,

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,599
the body language that matters the most is not eye contact.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,500
That's what people focus that they think eye contact

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,780
is the most important signal.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,480
It's not because people learn very different things

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,879
in different households and cultures,

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,640
personality differences that change how people

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,719
choose to make eye contact in different situations.

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,300
What matters is the asyncrany

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,600
between the emotions conveyed with the words

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,100
and the emotions conveyed with the body language.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,200
So if you're telling a happy story,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,620
but you do not look happy,

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,380
your body language doesn't look happy,

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,260
you don't come across as authentic.
