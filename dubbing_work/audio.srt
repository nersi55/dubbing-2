1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
What the fuck are you saying?

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,600
It's the most bizarre headline.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,759
The biggest corporations in the history of America,

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,679
the biggest corporations in the history of the world,

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,759
the richest corporations in the history of the world,

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,280
they're making money like we've never seen before,

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,839
but they don't want to pay their workers.

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,480
A lot of times they didn't want to have workers.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,719
They don't want to have American workers.

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,559
Look at Amazon.

11
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,719
In 2024, Amazon's net sales top 600 billion.

12
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,879
637 billion to be exact.

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,320
Their net income doubled from 2023 to 2024.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Amazon's president earned $40.1 million in total compensation.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,759
Previous year, he'd earned merely 29.2.

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,679
I mean, that's an unbelievable,

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,880
but that's great work if you can get it.

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,079
What's an unbelievable raise?

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,960
Only problem is Amazon's average worker,

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,840
average employee worldwide is making $37,181.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
So that's a C-suite to employee ratio of 1,078 to 1.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,000
I mean, how you supposed to raise a family on $37,000?
